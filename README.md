## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cypress-typescript-testing
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the Cypress tests, use the following command:

```
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run your tests.

### Writing Tests

You can write your tests in the `cypress/e2e` directory. The `example.cy.ts` file contains a sample test that demonstrates how to use Cypress commands.

### Custom Commands

If you need to create custom commands, you can define them in the `cypress/support/commands.ts` file.

### Configuration

You can customize the Cypress configuration in the `cypress.config.ts` file. This includes settings like the base URL and viewport size.

### TypeScript Configuration

The TypeScript configuration is defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. Make sure to adjust the settings according to your project's needs.
